# X-station-Template-for-Behringer-PRO-800

The goal with this template is to access most (if not all) of the Pro-800 midi CC parameters.
The second goal was to have the most used parameters hands-on.

20240206: Initial version, Not tested. (I suspect some stepsizes for buttons are wrong since they are not provided by Behringer)

Please test and leave suggestions or report bugs. Please fork from this repo if you continue development.
